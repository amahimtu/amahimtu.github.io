	<h3>Explore the world's most iconic drum machines.</h3><br>
	<div><p><span id="dmlab">DrumMachine Lab</span> is a smartphone, tablet, and desktop app that allows users to explore the world's most iconic drum machines. this project will walk you through my ui/ux design process for the app. you may also interact with a <a href="#xdprototype">clickable prototype.</a><br>
	Tools used: Adobe XD, Illustrator, Photoshop, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap.</p></div>

	<div><img src="iPhone11.jpg" alt="DrumMachine Lab" class="center" id="dmlabiphone"></div>

	<div id="process"><h3>The Process.</h3>
		<p>My interest in music production led me to come up with the concept for <span id="dmlab">DrumMachine Lab</span>. The idea behind the app is that music producers, regardless of their level of experience, can try out software versions of typically hardware drum machines on their smartphone, tablet, or desktop. For this project, I will be showcasing the smartphone version of the app. <br>

		Why might someone use <span id="dmlab">DrumMachine Lab</span>? They can:
		<ul>
			<li>Try out and play with iconic drum machines.</li>
			<li>Design sounds and produce beats and rhythms via drum machines.</li>
			<li>Connect the app to their preferred Digital Audio Workstation (DAW), and save and export MIDI and audio files.</li>
		</ul>
	</p></div><br>

	<div id="goals"><h3>Goals.</h3>
	<p>Some broad goals I had in mind for the user as I started this project:
	<ul><li>Exploration</li>
		<li>Sound design</li>
		<li>Entertainment</li>
		<li>Trying out software drum machines before investing in the 'real' thing</li>
		<li>Save space</li>
		<li>Save money</li>
		<li>Become a better beatmaker/producer</li>
	</ul>
</p>
</div><br>


	<div><h3>User Personas.</h3>
	<p>I came up with some user personas, i.e, potential <span id="dmlab">DrumMachine Lab</span> users. This got me thinking, “Who is the target audience for this app?”</p>
	<figure><img id="persona" src="personas.png" alt="Personas" class="center"><figcaption>Personas of potential users</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>
	<p>Broadly, the app’s target audience is people between the ages of 18-50 with an interest in music production and/or beatmaking. Of course, if I were to develop and publish the app, more market research would be needed to narrow down a target audience. </p>
   </div>
   <br>

	<div id="researchandtesting"><h3>Notes from Research and Testing.</h3>
		<p>Since this project does not involve a real client and the app is aimed at a fairly niche group of potential users, I was not able to conduct extensive user testing. However, speaking to three musicians who are casual music producers—all recent graduates of universities in Ohio and Michigan—it appears people are likely to use the app as long as it is affordable, fun, and easy to use. Producers often spend a lot of money on music software and plugins, so the app would need to be clever in its monetization strategy if it were to come to fruition. <br><br>
 
The app would ideally use officially licensed software versions of drum machines from companies like Roland, Arturia, and Korg. If users enjoy the software machines, they may look to buy the ‘real’ hardware machines from these companies, so hardware manufacturers are incentivized to pay <span id="dmlab">DrumMachine Lab</span> to feature their machines. <br><br>
 
Based on my research, while there are some online drum machines, there does not appear to be a singular platform for producers to be able to browse through a comprehensive collection of existing drum machines. 
</p>

<div id="contentandinteractionmap"><h3>Content and Interaction Map.</h3>
<p>With some testing and research done, I started the design thinking process: how the content of the app is organized and how users would interact with the app. I started to visualize the invisible. I created a rough user flowchart below, followed by a sitemap.</p>
<figure><img id="roughinteractionmap" src="rough-interaction-map.jpg" alt="Rough interaction map" class="center"><figcaption>Rough interaction map/user flowchart</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure><img id="finishedsitemap" src="finished-sitemap.png" alt="Sitemap" class="center"><figcaption>Finished sitemap</figcaption>
</figure><br>
<p>The sitemap is color coded according to groups of activities that a user would interact with and experience.</p>
</div>
<br>


<div id="wireframes"><h3>Wireframes.</h3>
<p>Using the sitemap as a framework, I created wireframes and then a wireframe map with a number of screens to show how a typical user would navigate through the app. I began to think more deeply about my prototype and started to hone in on the visual tone and feel.</p>

</figure></div><br>

<div id="prototype"><h3>Prototype.</h3>
<p>Based on my experience with music production software, I went for a clean, sleek look. Lots of blue, grey, and black, with a hint of green for freshness. Check out the partially functional prototype of <span id="dmlab">DrumMachine Lab</span> below! While the machines aren’t playable yet, I hope to one day develop and launch the app.</p>
</div><br>

<div id="prosandcons"><h3>Reflection: Advantages & Drawbacks</h3>
<p>After creating the prototype, I reflected on <span id="dmlab">DrumMachine Lab</span> and thought of some advantages and drawbacks for users. There are more pros than cons, which is always a good sign.</p><br>
<p>Drawbacks:
	<ul>
		<li>Software drum machines may not have the full functionality/complexity of hardware ones, so the app would have limited features.</li>
		<li>Smartphones have a relatively small screen so it’s hard to play the machines. This is addressed by iPad and desktop versions of the app.</li>
		<li>Licensing with well-known companies would be difficult. But it can encourage more users to get the app if products are officially licensed.</li>
	</ul><br>

	Advantages:

	<ul>
		<li>Users can try out software versions of drum machines before before buying physical ones (They are expensive).</li>
		<li>Users can play on the go.</li>
		<li>Users can record and export MIDI/Audio.</li>
		<li>The app can help bring "classic" drum machines back into the mainstream, like the rise of record players and vinyl in recent years.</li>
		<li><span id="dmlab">DrumMachine Lab</span> is great for music enthusiasts and experienced producers who already know a lot about drum machines, but at the same time the app could encourage novice producers to learn more about drum machines, beatmaking, and music production.</li>

	</ul>

	<p>Thanks for checking out my first UI/UX project!</p>
