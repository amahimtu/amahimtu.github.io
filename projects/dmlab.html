	<h2><span id="dmlab">DrumMachine Lab</span></h2>
	<h3><span id="dr">Explore</span> the world's most iconic drum machines.</h3><br>
	<div><h3>Overview.</h3><p><span id="dmlab">DrumMachine Lab</span> is envisioned as a smartphone, tablet, and desktop application that allows users to explore and play software versions of the world's most iconic drum machines. this project will walk you through my ui/ux design process leading up to the <a href="#xdprototype">clickable prototype</a> and <a href="#dmlabvideo">video prototype</a> of the app.<br>
	Tools used: Adobe: XD, Illustrator, Photoshop; HTML, CSS.</p></div>

	<div><img src="../images/iPhone11.jpg" alt="DrumMachine Lab" class="center" id="dmlabiphone"></div>

	<div id="process"><h3>The Process.</h3>
		<p>My interest in music production led me to come up with the concept for <span id="dmlab">DrumMachine Lab</span>. The idea behind the app is that users, such as music producers and fans of classic drum machines, can try out software versions of typically analog/hardware drum machines on their smartphones, tablets, or desktops. For this project, I will be showcasing the smartphone version of the app. <br>

		Why might someone use <span id="dmlab">DrumMachine Lab</span>? They can:
		<ul>
			<li>Try out and play iconic drum machines.</li>
			<li>Design sounds and produce beats and rhythms via drum machines.</li>
			<li>Connect the app to their preferred Digital Audio Workstation (<span id="pi">DAW</span>), and save and export MIDI and audio files.</li>
		</ul>
	</p></div><br>

	<div id="goals"><h3>Goals.</h3>
	<p>Some broad goals I had in mind for the user as I started this project:
	<ul><li>Exploration</li>
		<li>Sound design</li>
		<li>Entertainment</li>
		<li>Trying out software drum machines before investing in the 'real' thing</li>
		<li>Save space</li>
		<li>Save money</li>
		<li>Become a better beatmaker/producer</li>
	</ul>
</p>
</div><br>


	<div><h3>User Personas.</h3>
	<p>I came up with some user personas, i.e, potential <span id="dmlab">DrumMachine Lab</span> users. This got me thinking, “Who is the target audience for this app?”</p>
	<figure><img id="persona" src="../images/personas@2x.png" alt="Personas" class="center"><figcaption>Personas of potential users</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>
	<p>Broadly, the app’s target audience is people between the ages of 18-50 with an interest in music production, beatmaking, and/or drum machines. Of course, if I were to develop and publish the app, more market research would be needed to narrow down a target audience. </p>
   </div>
   <br>

	<div id="researchandtesting"><h3>Notes from Research and Testing.</h3>
		<p>Since this is a personal project and the application is aimed at a fairly niche group of users, I was not able to conduct extensive user testing. However, speaking to five musicians who are casual music producers—all recent graduates of universities in Ohio and Michigan—it appears they are inclined to use the app as long as it is affordable, fun, and easy to use. Producers often spend a lot of money on music software and plugins, so the app would need to be clever in its monetization strategy if it were to come to fruition. <br><br>
 
The app would ideally use officially licensed software versions of drum machines from companies like Roland, Arturia, and Korg. If users enjoy the software machines, they may look to buy the ‘real’ hardware machines from these companies, so hardware manufacturers are incentivized to pay <span id="dmlab">DrumMachine Lab</span> to feature their drum machines. <br><br>
 
Based on my research, while there are some online drum machines, there does not appear to be a singular platform for producers to be able to browse and play through a comprehensive collection of existing drum machines.

<div id="contentandinteractionmap"><h3>Information Architecture: Content Map, Interaction Map, and Sitemap.</h3>
<p>With some testing and research done, I started the design thinking process: how the content of the app is organized and how users would interact with the app. I started to visualize the invisible. I created content maps and a rough user flowchart as shown below, followed by a sitemap.</p>
<figure id="roughcontentmaps"><img id="contentmap1" src="../images/contentmap1.jpeg" alt="Rough content map 1"><img id="contentmap2" src="../images/contentmap2.jpeg" alt="Rough content map 2"><figcaption>Rough content maps</figcaption></figure>
<figure><img id="roughinteractionmap" src="../images/rough-interaction-map.jpg" alt="Rough interaction map" class="center"><figcaption>Rough interaction map/user flowchart</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure><img id="finishedsitemap" src="../images/finished-sitemap@2x.png" alt="Finished sitemap" class="center"><figcaption>Finished sitemap</figcaption>
</figure><br>
<p>The sitemap is color-coded according to groups of activities that a user would interact with and experience.</p>
</div>
<br>


<div id="wireframes"><h3>Wireframes.</h3>
<p>Using the sitemap as a framework, I created wireframes and then a wireframe map with a number of screens to show how a typical user would navigate through the app. I began to think more deeply about my prototype and started to hone in on the visual tone and feel.</p>

</figure></div><br>

<div id="prototype"><h3>Interactive Prototype + Video.</h3>
<p>Based on my experience with music production software, I went for a clean, sleek look. Lots of blue, grey, and black, with a hint of green for freshness. Check out the partially functional prototype of <span id="dmlab">DrumMachine Lab</span> below! While the machines aren’t playable yet, I hope to eventually develop and launch a version of the app.</p>

<div id="dmlabvideo"><p>You can also check out the video demo of the smartphone prototype with <a href="../music.html">original audio</a> by me.</p>
<div class="video-container"></p><iframe title="DrumMachine Lab Video Prototype" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_GACGX4dcjU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br></div>

<div id="prosandcons"><h3>Reflection: Advantages & Drawbacks</h3>
<p>After creating the prototype, I reflected on <span id="dmlab">DrumMachine Lab</span> and thought of some advantages and drawbacks for users. There are more pros than cons, which is always a good sign.</p><br>
<p>Drawbacks:
	<ul>
		<li>Software drum machines may not have the full functionality/complexity of hardware ones, so the app would have limited features.</li>
		<li>Smartphones have a relatively small screen so it’s hard to play the machines. This is addressed by iPad and desktop versions of the app.</li>
		<li>Licensing with well-known companies would be difficult. But it can encourage more users to get the app if products are officially licensed.</li>
	</ul><br>

	Advantages:

	<ul>
		<li>Users can try out software versions of drum machines before before buying physical ones (They are expensive).</li>
		<li>Users can play on the go.</li>
		<li>Users can record and export MIDI/Audio.</li>
		<li>Tutorials and ease of use.</li>
		<li>The app can help bring vintage drum machines back into the mainstream, like the rise of record players and vinyl in recent years.</li>
		<li><span id="dmlab">DrumMachine Lab</span> is great for music enthusiasts, experienced producers, and drum machine fans, but at the same time, the app could encourage novice producers to learn more about drum machines, beatmaking, and music production.</li>

	</ul>

	<p>Thanks for checking out my first UI/UX project! I welcome <a href = "../contact.html">feedback</a>.</p>
